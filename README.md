A curious attempt at emulating Half-Life's Software mode water. (screenshots & videos coming soon)  
There is some stuff left to do, such as:
- loading different shaders for different 'ideas'
- loading different textures
- preferably doing all that thru ImGui
- viewing the thing in 3D, preferably with an example scene
